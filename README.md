### This is my portfolio website that I designed using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and used [Next JS](https://nextjs.org/). I'm in love with Next JS. I made it Open Source so that people can also contribute.

### If you want to use this for your own portfolio website as a template, do it but ```make sure you give credits to me in your footer or about page```.
